# Battleship - The Classic Naval Combat Game
Recreated in C++ by Spencer Nielsen

### Your Mission:
Be the first to sink all five of your opponents ships.

### Gameplay:
Select where you want to place your ships. Once all ships are placed, select your first coordinates to launch an attack.
If the coordinate you selected is occupied by an enemy ship, you score a hit and continue selecting coordinates until you
miss. Then the other player (CPU in this case) selects coordinates until a miss. 

### Game Conclusion:
If you sink all of the other player's ships before they can you win! Otherwise if the other player accomplishes this goal 
sooner, then you lose!
